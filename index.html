            <h3>This is a blog post!</h3>
            <p>This will show up as the text for my blog post. It will be styled, by default, to be a normal font size, which makes it good "reading" text -- the kind that you might find in a paragraph in a book.</p>
            <p>You can use paragraph elements as much as you need, and sometimes you may want to style the text within an element. You can do that by using a <span> element.</p>
            <p>It's easiest to think about "highlighting" text with a span. <span style="background-color:yellow;">If you wanted just this text to be yellow, you could use a span to do that!</span></p>
